<h1> Padres Football 2020 </h1>

</center>
            Carmel Padres Football. With a competitive season last year in the highest divison, the padres are looking to contine their success. However, with the loss of their star QB Kai Lee and RB Dakota Mornihweg next season will prove to be another difficult season. Other notable seniors include Lavar Edwards and Nico Staehle. Next season the Padres hope to utilize the talent of TE Jt Byrne, WR Benicio Cristafalo, and other non seniors who stepped up last season. One question that will be interesting to have answered is...Who will be at the QB helm next season? Jt Byrne stepped up against San Benito last year earning a dub and finishing the year with a 141 passer rating. However, JT's excellent year at TE has earned him offers from Yale, Cornell, and Oregon St for Te. Meaning, Byrne will likely appear at TE again next season. Another possible answer is sophmore Tristan Staehle. Being pulled up his freshman year for playoffs Staehle scored a TD on his first carry. Since then Staehle has lacked playing time, mostly appearing on special teams and warming up behind Lee. However, when Staehle got in the game he threw just one incomplete pass and averaged 8 yards per carry. Only time will tell, come out and see the Padres soon!
